<h1>Applesauce Oat Muffins</h1><p>Low fat&#44; low sugar&#44; quick and easy recipe I clipped from a magazine somewhere. You can top with a light sprinkle of cinnamon sugar instead of the topping they recommend.  I have also added raisins&#44; craisins&#44; and other dried fruit.

Combine:
1 1/2 c quick-cooking oats
1 1/4 c flour
1/2 c packed brown sugar
1 t bkg pwdr
3/4 t bkg soda
3/4 ground cinnamon
1/2 t salt

Combine in a separate bowl:
1 c applesauce
1/2 milk
3 T vegetable oil
1 egg white
Stir the wet into the dry just until moistened. Spoon into muffin cups. The recipe says it makes 10&#44; but I get a dozen without skimping.
Topping:
1/4 quick-cooking oats
1 T brown sugar
1/8 t ground cinnamon
1 T butter&#44; melted
Mix well and sprinkle over muffins. Bake at 400&#44; 16-20 min.</p>
