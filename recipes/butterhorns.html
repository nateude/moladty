<p>The receipe came from my Grandmother Gurgel. The way I copied it is the way Mother got it from her. There was nothing better than waking up on a Saturday morning to the smell of butterhorns coming out of the oven. My mother made these off and on through out the year. Probably when my Dad was hungry for them. I started making them for Easter and putting them in your Easter baskets so you would have something fairly decent to eat before you attacked all that candy!</p>
