<h1>Fleischkuechle</h1><p>Here we are at another German favorite.  Deep fried meat pies that pair well with German potato salad. Irene Hopfinger&#44; the mother of one of my school children in Lemmon&#44; South Dakota made this for me early in my stay. The community was so very German that these were made and sold at the local drive in. Unfortunately the drive in had closed by the time I arrived in town. The only trick is to make certain the pastry is well sealed before deep frying. The moisture in the meat can really sizzle and spit otherwise.
Pastry:
Mix: 3 c four
1 t salt
Make a well in the center of flour and in the hole add:
2 eggs
1/2 c cream or half and half or evaporated milk (cream is best)
fill the rest with water if needed. Stir until moistened and a ball
forms. Pull walnut sized pieces from dough and roll flat about the
size of a small dessert plate. Fill with meat filling&#44; fold in half and
seal tightly by rolling the edge of a plate around the half circle.
Deep fry until golden brown on both sides&#44; drain and serve hot.
Meat Filling:
1 c ground beef
1 c ground pork
chopped onion
1/2 c water
mix until well blended. Use about
1 heaping T per pie. The meat will
shrink as it cooks. Be careful when
biting into it. The grease inside is hot.</p>
