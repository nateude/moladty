<h1>Frozen Crescent Rolls</h1><p>These are NOT butter horns. They LOOK like butter horns but it is a different yeast dough. This is what I would make to serve with Thanksgiving and Christmas Dinners&#44; or any company dinner. I used them because you make them up completely ahead of time and remove from the freezer in the morning to rise and bake. Hot and fresh from the oven but made weeks in advance. How cool is that! The recipe comes from the Best of Country Cooking Cook Book.

Dissolve 2 packages of yeast in 2 cups of warm milk. Set aside.

In mixer beat and cream:
1 cup sugar
1 cup shortening
2 tsp salt
Add 6 beaten eggs and mix well.
Add milk mixture and 4 1/2 cups  of flour
Mix with mixer until moistened
By hand stir and knead in 4 or more cups of flour
Knead well and let rise until double in bulk.
Divide dough into 4 parts.
Roll each into circle and cut into 16 wedges.
Brush wedges with melted butter and roll toward the peak.
Place on cookie sheet and freeze. Remove when frozen
and place in plastic bags.
4 hours before baking remove from freezer and place on
cookie sheets. Let rise  until doubled and bake at 350 for 12-15 min.</p>
