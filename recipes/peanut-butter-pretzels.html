<h1>Peanut Butter Pretzels</h1><p>I picked this recipe out of a magazine somewhere. You kids loved it. The frosting is my own addition&#44; which I lifted from another recipe in a different magazine. The frosting is a standard drizzle I use for many different cakes and sweet rolls. I will post it separately as well as here. You can also do a peanut butter topping if you wish but that frosting doesn&#39;t harden and the pretzels get sticky from it. Another option is to not frost them at all and dip them into Hershey&#39;s Syrup as you eat them.  I have used this recipe and procedure for the last five years for mini-classes at ILC.  Not a complaint registered yet.

Place 1 c. lukewarm water in mixing bowl
Add:
1 pkg dry active yeast (1 scant T)
2 T sugar
1 T butter or oil
1/2 t salt
stir and add:
1/3 c creamy peanut butter (do not use crunchy&#44; the dough won&#39;t roll when you need it to)
1 egg
gradually stir in:
3 c flour
1/2 c milk pwdr (you can use milk instead of the water and skip the pwdr&#44; but make sure the milk is lukewarm)

Knead well&#44; divide dough into 3 parts&#44; cover and let rest 10 min.
Divide each part into 6 and roll into 16 inch ropes and shape into pretzel shape.
Place on greased cookie sheet and let rest 20 min.
Bake at 375 for 10-12 min.  Stir glaze with fork and drizzle&#44; throw glaze over pretzels.

Glaze:
combine 1/4 c water with 1/4 c sugar. Boil until clear. Stir in chocolate chips&#44; slowly adding
chips until melted and glaze is drizzling consistency.  Glaze will harden as the pretzels cool.

Peanut Butter Frosting
Mix and stir until smooth
1/2 c pwdr sugar
1/4 c peanut butter&#44; creamy or crunchy
3-6 T evaporated milk
You could make this on the runny side and dip the pretzels too.
