<h1>Pffeffernuesse</h1><p>My Dad remembers these with the story that his mother made them at Christmas and they ate them until Easter. Perfect cookies to go with coffee and hot chocolate. Make they little&#44; as in donut hole little. Get some help&#44; they need to be rolled cut baked and frosted twice. This recipe is the soft version. You don&#39;t break your teeth on the. My sister Jeannie got the recipe from a member where she taught in Jamestown. She made them for her wedding which was after just after Christmas. On the way home from said wedding we got caught in a real Mid-West blizzard. Had to pull of the interstate and get a motel for the night.  We still talk about that trip home.  Also this is the full version&#44; I cut it in half. Read the whole recipe before you decide to take on the full project.

Bring to boil and cool one half hour:

4 c sugar

3 c honey

To the sugar/honey add:

1 c butter

1 c sour cream

6 beaten eggs

1 1/2 c cold coffee (liquid&#44; brewed or instant&#44; made like you would drink it if you liked it.)

3 tsp soda

2 tsp baking powder

3 tsp salt

2 tsp  black pepper

2 tsp cinnamon

2 tsp all spice

2 tsp cloves

4 tsp anise

14 c flour or enough to make a heavy dough. It  will still be sticky. Add flour as you roll it out. Flour cutter often also. Roll 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick.

Do not skip any of the ingredients even if they seem weird. They all blend together and the cookies do not taste like coffee at all.

Bake at 350 for about 10 minutes.  Dip in frosting and allow to dry on rack. Dip bottom and allow to dry again in the open air over night. Store in coffee cans or freeze or leave in your cookie jar for months until you discover them again and they will still be good. Really.

Frosting: Lots of powder sugar and a little water at a time to make a glaze&#44; fairly thin.</p>
