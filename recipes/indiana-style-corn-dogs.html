<h1>Indiana-Style Corn Dogs</h1><p>No history here&#44; just  a good&#44; deep fried&#44; corn dog recipe from The Best of Country Cooking cookbook.  Fast&#44; easy&#44; make ahead and freeze to be heated later in the microwave.  The thin wooden skewers work better as sticks than Popsicle sticks. I have used both and even though it takes some hand strength to do it&#44; have cut the skewers in half. Make sure the oil is water drop sizzle hot&#44; it is the right temp when you place a corn dog into it and the corn dog sends up bubbles and quickly emerges to the top of the oil.  You may find you need a few extra drops of milk to thin the batter. If it is too thick you get more &#39;corn&#39; than dog. A good rule of thumb is so that the excess batter slides easily and still leaves the dog coated&#44; like custard from a spoon when it is thick. (Wait who would know anymore what that&#39;s like?) Ok&#44; you&#39;ll know the batter is too thick if you try to pull the dog out of the batter by the end of the stick embedded in it and the dog stays and the stick comes out.  Have fun.

Mix:
1/2 c yellow cornmeal
1 c flour
1 T bkg pwdr
1 t salt
1 T sugar
1/4 t paprika
1/2 t dry mustard (I often use more like a teaspoon or just plunk some in)
Stir in separate bowl
1 egg
1 cup evaporated milk (no substitutes)
combine mixtures&#44; adding extra drops of milk if needed&#44; see above&#44;
Place part of the batter in a tall&#44; narrow  glass&#44; skewer thawed&#44; and dried  hot dogs&#44; dip&#44; fry&#44; drain and eat.
The corn dogs are deep gold to brown when done.  Batter will coat 10-16 hot dogs depending on
on thickness of batter.</p>
