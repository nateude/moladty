<h1>Chocolate Glaze</h1><p>Use this glazed over a bunt cake&#44; cookies&#44; peanut butter pretzels&#44; sweet rolls etc. It hardens as it cools&#44; add more chips to make it thick&#44; fewer for a thinner glaze. If it gets crusty before you are done with it warm it in the microwave and stir. Throwing it of the tines of a fork gives an artsy look&#44; or you can dip or spread it.

Combine 1/4 c water with 1/4 c sugar. Boil until clear. Stir in chocolate chips until melted and glaze is desiredÂ consistency.</p>
