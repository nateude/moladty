<h1>Amish Waffles</h1><p>Waffles are a favorite for brunch and this recipe goes together quickly. No beating the egg whites separately and you can add any kind of fruit. Apples&#44; blueberries&#44; even bananas work. I love the fruity topping/syrup that is suppose to go with these&#44; but my old standby brown sugar syrup is what the boys like the best so I seldom go the trouble of making it. Â The recipe in my book is copied by hand&#44; don&#39;t remember where I got it. I found it again later on Cooks.com.

Mix in order given and bake in waffle iron.
2 c flour
1 1/2 c milk
2 1/2 t bkg pwdr
2 eggs well beaten
5 T vegetable oil or butter
1 t vanilla

Topping:

In saucepan over medium heat combine and cook:
1 2/3 c water
2/3 c sugar
2 T white corn syrup
2 drops red food coloring
2 T cornstarch (Mix cornstarch with sugar and add water slowly so it doesn&#39;t lump)
Cook until thickened and add&#44;
1 (3 oz) pkg raspberry Jell-o

I have used any combination of berries&#44; even strawberries for the topping and different flavors of Jell-O too.</p>
