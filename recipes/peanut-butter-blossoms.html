<h1>Peanut Butter Blossoms</h1><p>Before Aaron and Meghan were married they liked to cook in our kitchen. We all know how Aaron cooks! One night they made this recipe&#44; it comes from Meghan&#44; and the mess&#44; was worth it! she gave me the recipe and I lost it. So Meghan sent it again I am posting it.  I intended to make these this year but time is running out quickly.

Combine and mix on low speed:

3 1/2 c flour

1 t salt

2 t soda

1 c brown sugar

1 c white sugar

1 c butter

1 c peanut butter

4 T milk

2 eggs

2 t vanilla

Shape dough into balls  using a rounded teaspoon for each.  Roll in sugar and place on pan. Bake at 375 10-12 minutes.

Top each cookie immediately with a Hershey&#39;s Kiss (unwrapped) pressing down firmly so that each cookie cracks around the edge.</p>
