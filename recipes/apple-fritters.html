<h1>Apple Fritters</h1><p>Combine:

1 beaten egg

1 cup milk

1 cup finely chopped or grated cored ( not peeled) apple (I always put in more)

1/4 cup sugar

3 tablespoons orange jucie

2 tsp vanilla

stir together

2 cups all purpose flour

1 tablespoon baking powder

Mix into apple mixture

Drop by teaspoon into hot oil.Â  Fry until deep golden brown turning once

Drain on brown paper and dip in sugar&#44; cinnamon sugar or sift powder sugar over the tops

I find that grated apples work the best and I use at least twice what the recei</p>
