<h1>Marshmallows</h1><p>After the marshmallow fight at the Labor Day Camp out I hesitate to post this! Â The recipe came from Chris Lentz&#44; member in Fridley&#44; and professional pastry chef. Everyone should experience home made marshmallows at some point. They make the ones from the store good only for shooting from guns or throwing at your brother!

about 1 cup of confectioners&#39; sugar
3 1/2 envelopes unflavored gelatin
1/2 cup cold water
2 cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup hot water (about 115 degrees)
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla

Oil bottom and sides of a 9X13 pan. Pam spray works. Dust with some of the confectioner&#39;s sugar.

In a bowl of a standing electric mixer sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water and let stand to soften.

In a 3 quart heavy saucepan cook granulated sugar&#44; corn syrup&#44; hot water and salt over low heat&#44; stirring with a wooden spoon until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat to moderate and boil mixture&#44; without stirring until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F&#44; about 12 minutes. Remove pan from heat and pour sugar mixture over gelatin mixture&#44; stirring until gelatin is dissolved. Beat with mixer on high until substance is thick&#44; white and nearly tripled in volume and not warm&#44; about 6 min. Incorporate vanilla. Pour mixture into pan and sift 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar evenly over the top. No need to cover. Let stand at room temperature for a few hours until firm or over night.

Run a knife around the edges of the pan and invert pan onto a large board. Lifting up one corner of the the pan&#44; with fingers loosen one edge and let drop to board. With a large knife trim edges of marshmallow and cut into 1 inch cubes. Sift remaining confectioners&#39; sugar into a large bowl and gently toss marshmallows to coat. Marshmallows keep in an air tight container for up to a week. Makes about 96 marshmallows.</p>
