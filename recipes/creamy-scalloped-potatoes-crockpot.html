<h1>Creamy Scalloped Potatoes Crockpot</h1><p>Scalloped potatoes were a standard as I was growing up. Sometimes Mom layered them with ham as well as corn&#44; sometimes she put hot dogs on top and broiled them at the end of the cooking time. Trying to write down her recipe would mean guessing amounts&#44; she did it&#44; I watched&#44; and I do it. The recipe I am posting I got from Cooks.com. It is awesome&#44; easy and turns out perfect. I have layered it with both ham and corn and with only corn&#44; never used the hot dogs though.  The cheese is optional.

2 lbs thinly sliced potatoes&#44; 6 medium&#44;  peeled or scrubbed with skins still on
1 sm onion thinly sliced
1/4 c flour
1 t salt
1/4 t pepper
3 T butter
1 can cream of mushroom soup
4 slices American cheese&#44; (or other as desired)
1 c water
1/2 t cream of tartar

Toss potato slices in water and cream of tartar. Drain. Put half of potatoes in greased crockpot. Top with half of onion slices&#44; ham&#44; corn etc. Sprinkle with half of flour&#44; salt and pepper. Make second layer and sprinkle rest of flour and seasonings on top. Add butter and undiluted soup&#44; cover and cook on low 7-9 hours&#44; or high 3-4. Add cheese 30 min before serving. Recipe may be doubled.
My notes tell me I added the grated &#44;co-jack cheese in with the layers&#44;  have made it without the flour and I know once I forgot to rinse the potatoes in the cream of tartar. Turned out every time.</p>
