<h1>Cowboy cookies</h1><p>This recipe was in the second edition of the Messiah Hales Corners Cookbook.Â  It would be my top pick for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. The large flaked coconut keeps them chewy and should not be skipped. I first found the coconut chips at a health food store in Madison. It takes a little to track them down but I have been able to every place we have lived.
