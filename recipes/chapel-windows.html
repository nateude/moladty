<h1>Chapel Windows</h1><p>Because the original recipe has eggs in it and no cooking required I altered it slightly.  Remember when adding eggs to hot liquids beat the eggs separately and add small amounts of the hot liquid into the eggs&#44; beating after each addition.  Otherwise you could easily end up with scrambled eggs in your mixture and you will have to start over. If you heat the mixtures in the microwave cook the egg mixture on a low heat&#44; 60% power and stir often. If using the stove use a low heat and stir constantly.

Melt:
12 oz of chocolate chips
4 T of butter
Add:
2 eggs
Return to stove or microwave and cook until the mixture with the eggs have heated sufficiently.
Cool:
Add:
2 cups pwder sugar and mix well and cool again.
Stir in 1 package colored mini-marshmallows.
Roll into logs and roll and press shredded coconut on the outside.
Roll in wax paper and chill or freeze. Cut and serve when ready.
Chopped nuts can be added with the pwdr sugar also.
