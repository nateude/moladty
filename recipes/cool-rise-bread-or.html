<h1>Cool Rise Bread</h1><p>Don&#39;t ask me to remember their names&#44; it has been too many years since we met as  new moms in the LaLache League group in Cambridge&#44; WI. Our group was rather unique. We met for years and were as much of a mother&#39;s group as a support group for breast feeding. It was one of the members of that group who passed this recipe on to the rest of us. It is truly a life saver.  A quick 20 minute rest period and then the dough goes into pans. Bake it now or bake it later although I have never had much success with leaving it for long in the frig. It tends to rise too high and run over the pans even though the recipe says it should be ok for 2-24 hours.

4 pks yeast (4 scant T)
4 t salt
1/2 c  sugar
2/3 c butter or oil
1 1/3 c milk pwdr
4 eggs
4 c lukewarm water
Mix&#44; stir and slowly add
14 c flour&#44; knead well&#44;
Let rest 20 minutes&#44; knead vigorously and divide into
four loaves. Place in greased loaf pans and let rise until
doubled in bulk or place in frig  with tops greased and covered
with plastic wrap and let sit 2-24 hours.
Take out of frig and let sit for ten minutes while pre-heating
oven. Bake 350 for 30-35 min.</p>
