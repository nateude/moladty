<h1>Curried Beef (or Chicken)</h1><p>This is not so much a recipe as a procedure. I was looking Â for different rice dishes for Raju and found this. Raju comes to the house for rice on Tuesdays. When I use curry he enters in near ecstasy&#44; "Ahhh&#44; curry!" Even in the winter the smell of the curry carrie

Heat olive oil in a pan&#44; (I use the wok). Add a generous amount of curry powder. I use less when I use what Matt brings from India than if I use what I get in the states. I am guessing I start with a tablespoon. Add thin slices or cubes of beef or chicken. Stir and fry until no longer pink. Add veggies&#44; onions&#44; peppers&#44; green beans&#44; or thin slices of carrots or baby carrots. Cover and simmer for 30-40 min. I taste during the process to check for seasoning amounts. Add curry as desired. Served over hot rice. Notice&#44; you do not make a sauce. The olive oil mixed with the juices from the meat and veggies is enough.

I have tried making Naan bread to go with this. To date I have not been too successful. Mixing the bread&#44; rolling it&#44; is not difficult. The problem is in how to bake it.</p>
