<h1>Eggnog</h1><p>This is the recipe that I have used for years.  Works well&#44; the eggs get cooked.  I am not going to list all the stirs in they suggest.  I add rum to taste and a dash of nutmeg.  The recipe calls for milk but any combination of half and half&#44; milk and cream works.  Just depends on how rich you want it.

Beat together:

6 eggs

1/4 cup sugar

1/4 tsp salt (op)

Stir in 2 cups of milk and heat over low heat stirring constantly until mixture thickens and coats spoon.  Remove from heat and stir in remaining 2 cups of milk.

Add:

1 tsp vanilla

Cover and refrigerate several hours or overnight.  Just before serving stir in rum and a pinch of nutmeg.

Makes 12 1/2 cup servings.</p>
