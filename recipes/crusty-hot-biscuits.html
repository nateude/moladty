<h1>Crusty Hot Biscuits</h1><p>My faithful&#44; standard biscuit recipe from a cook book Grandma Ude gave me years and years ago. The book opens almost instantly to this page and the spatter marks confirm how often it has been consulted. I have cut this in half&#44; using only half an egg is tricky. I use the yolk only when I do and it still comes out fine. This is also the recipe I use for the chicken potpie top and dumplings when I make them.

In large bowl mix:
2 1/4 c. flour
4 t bkg pwdr
1/2 t cream of tartar
1/2 t salt
2 T sugar
Cut in:
1/3 c shortening
Stir in:
2/3 c milk
1 egg
Mix until dough follows fork around the bowl. Knead 5-6 times&#44; roll&#44; pat&#44; or drop onto sheet.
If dropping Â from spoon&#44; slightly more milk may be needed to make a softer dough. Bake at 450
for 10-12 min.

If using in soup as dumplings
drop into boiling soup&#44; boil ten min uncovered and ten covered. Add fresh chopped parsley
to the dumplings while mixing.

By adding shredded cheddar cheese and brushing the biscuits before and after they are baked
with melted garlic butter you get close to the Red Lobster&#39;s cheddar biscuits.</p>
