<h1>Great American Chowder</h1><p>Laura requested the Corn Chowder recipe. I don&#39;t use a recipe for that&#44; I just make it. This however is essentially the same&#44; depending on the vegetables that you choose to put in and the meat. For Corn Chowder I use only the bacon&#44; onions and the corn and I thicken it with instant potato flakes&#44; stirring in a handful at a time ten minutes or so before serving and skipping the flour that this recipe uses.. The amounts listed here makes about 7 cups.

6 slices of bacon

1 T vegetable oil

1 1/2 c chopped onions

1/4 c flour

3 c peeled and diced potatoes

3 c  c water (or  use half chicken broth and water)

1 c cooked ham&#44; chicken&#44; or turkey cubed ( use all&#44; some &#44; one or none)

1 c mixed vegetables of choice

salt to taste

pepper to taste

1 c undiluted evaporated milk

Cook bacon until crisp.  Drain&#44; add oil and onions and saute until soft&#44; stir in flour.  Add water slowly and stir with whisk until smooth&#44; add potatoes&#44; and vegetables&#44; meat and seasonings. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender&#44; stirring occasionally. Stir in milk and heat to serving temperature but do not boil.  To make a cheesy potato soup stir in cheese just before serving&#44; stirring until melted and smooth. If you want to be really Wisconsin&#44;  you can make it cheesy beer soup by adding beer for part of the water&#44; small part of course.  Really&#44; I have made it that way&#44; way back when Dad could still eat anything.</p>
