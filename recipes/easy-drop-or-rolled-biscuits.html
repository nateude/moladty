<h1>Easy Drop or Rolled Biscuits</h1><p>I have not tried this recipe. Chris shared it with me. It call for oil&#44; no cutting in of the shortening is needed.

In bowl mix:
2 c. flour
1 T. bkg pwdr
1/3 c. oil
2/3 c. milk
Stir until mixture forms ball. Knead 18-20 times. Roll&#44; pat or drop by tablespoon onto sheet.
Bake in 450 degree oven- no time given&#44; I&#39;m guessing 10 min.

If you try it&#44; let the rest of us know how you like it. Thanks</p>
