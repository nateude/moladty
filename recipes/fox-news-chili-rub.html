<h1>Fox News Chili Rub</h1><p>Meghan made boneless chicken thighs rubbed with this home made rub. Aaron&#44; Nate&#44; Beth and Dad all raved. Nate wanted the recipe so here it is.

Chili Rub
1 Tbls mustard powder
1 Tbls granulated garlic
1 Tbls onion powder
1 Tbls paprika
1 Tbls cayenne pepper
2 Tbls chili powder
1 1/2 C. dark brown sugar
1/2 C raw sugar
1/2 C kosher salt
1/2 C granulated sugar
Mix all until well incorporated and store in air tight container. Thoroughly coat chicken up to a day in advance. Place on tray and bake at 350 for 1-1 1/2 hours. Megan cuts back on the cayenne pepper and the salt. She also adds liquid smoke and granulated sugar may used instead of raw. (Use 1 cup regular granulated sugar then.) IÂ concur with the others. The result is delicious.</p>
