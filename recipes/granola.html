<h1>Granola</h1><p>Aaron just asked for this. He used to know it by heart.  I think we all knew it by heart. It is my old standard recipe.  I am not certain where it originated but I tweaked it to suit our taste. Please remember&#44; granola is not an exact science&#44; throw in different combinations of nuts and flavorings but ALWAYS add the dried fruit AFTER you are done baking it. The raisins etc get hard and too crusty if they bake with the rest.

8 cups rolled oats
1 cup peanuts
1 cup sunflower seeds
1 cup coconut chips&#44; (wide flat flakes NOT the skinny sweetened stuff)
1 cup brown sugar&#44; sprinkle and stir in
1 cup canola oil
1 T vanilla if desired mixed with oil
Stir until all is well coated with oil. Bake at 325 for an hour to an hour and a half&#44;
stirring every fifteen minutes. Sometimes after an hour I just turn off the oven
and let it sit until I remember it is in there. Never burns but gets nice and brown
and crunchy.  Add in several cups of raisins or add raisins as desired when serving.

Add ins that might be good:
wheat germ
flax
sesame seed
cinnamon
substitute part of the oil with fruit juice (tastes good but won&#39;t be as crunchy)</p>
