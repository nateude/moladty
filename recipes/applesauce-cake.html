<h1>Applesauce Cake</h1><p>Applesauce Cake was a Christmas favorite when I was growing up. Mom made it in loaf pans&#44; a 9x13 pan or muffin tins. It works as quick bread or a cake. The caramel frosting was as special as the cake. Mom always made it with nuts&#44; raisins and dates.  I am posting it&#44; not because any of you children asked for it&#44; but I made it this year to give away as Christmas gifts. Marie Meyer loved it and wanted the recipe so here it is. The caramel frosting recipe is from the Settlement Cookbook. If you want THAT story go to my website&#44; www.deborahude.com and read Cookbook.&#39;
