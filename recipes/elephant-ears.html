<h1>Elephant Ears</h1><p>Study Clubs happened&#44; not always once a month but&#44; they happened.The men sequestered themselves in the church offices or parlors to study and debate. The women sat around the parsonage living room and exchanged news&#44; compared child rearing experiences and exchanged recipes. It was a good time had by all and my stash of family favorite recipes increased greatly. Lois Albrecht gets the credit for these delightful pastries. They take a little bit of extra time and work but are worth the effort. They have always turned out beautifully. Be generous with the cinnamon and ground nuts. It makes them crusty and crispy.
