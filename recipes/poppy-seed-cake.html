<h1>Poppy Seed Cake</h1><p>Poppy seed anything was one of my mom&#39;s great favorites. The recipe she used comes from The Settlement Cookbook. It has a custard filling and chocolate frosting over all. It is similar to Boston Cream Pie. Because it is a white cake it is on the dry side of cakes&#44; but the custard filling and chocolate frosting save it. The layer cakes can be split into two and you can double the custard and fill five Â layers instead of two.

2 Tblspn cornstarch
1 1/2 tblspn cold milk cook on stove top or in microwave on 60% power until smooth.

Slowly add&#44; stirring constantly
1 1/2 c hot milk
cook on stove top on medium heat until custard thickens and coats the spoon. OR cook on 60% power a few minutes at a time in microwave&#44; stirring well with whisk or fork to keep the custard smooth. When thick&#44; like pudding remove from heat.
