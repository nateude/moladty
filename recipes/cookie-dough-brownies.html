<h1>Cookie Dough Brownies</h1><p>Found the recipe in the Country magazine&#44; it is a keeper. I added the mini chocolate chips or mini M&amp;M&#39;s to the middle layer. Bake the bottom layer and let it sit over night. Finishing in the morning is fast and easy. I would think these would freeze well but I haven&#39;t ever done it.
Mix:
2 c sugar
1 1/2 c flour
1/2 c bkg cocoa
1/2 tsp salt
1 c vegetable oil
4 eggs
2 t vanilla
Spread in a 9x13 pan and bake at 350 for 30 min. Cool completely.
Cookie Dough layer&#44; mix:
1/2 c butter
1/4 c sugar
1/2 c packed brown sugar
2 T milk
1 t vanilla
1 c flour
1 c mini chocolate chips or M&amp;M&#39;s
Spread over brownie layer. I find it works best to spray my hands with Pam
and use my finger tips to spread this.
Glaze:
1 c chocolate chips
1 T shortening
Melt and spread over Cookie Dough layer. Cut into bars and chill thoroughly.</p>
