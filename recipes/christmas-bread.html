This of course came from Grandma Ude and most likely from her mother&#44; Dad&#39;s Grandma Michaelson. It is a Norwegian bread. Cardamom is a favorite Scandinavian spice. This  along with lefse and fruit soup was the Christmas Eve supper for your father while he was growing up. The Gurgel family had no such traditions on Christmas Eve so it was easy to keep this up for the Ude&#39;s.</p>
