<h1>Taffy Apple Salad</h1><p>combine:

1/2 cup sugar   

mix well and add

1 beaten egg

2 tblsp cider vinegar

and the juice from 1 8oz can of crushed pineapple

cook until thick&#44; cool well ( at least several hours in frig)

drained&#44; crushed pineapple

I make the cooked dressing the night before or early in the morning and then mix the rest up right before serving. This is one of our favorite salads and worth making anytime of the year.</p>
