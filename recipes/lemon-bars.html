<h1>Lemon Bars</h1><p>Lemon pie in a bar would be a better name. This also was a bake off winner that became one of our family favorites. Â I can&#39;t say that I have ever had another lemon bar that measures up to these. They do not freeze well but they&#39;ll be gone before you can anyway.

Crust:
1 cup butter
1/2 cup pwdr sugar
2 cups flour
Mix well and press into jelly roll pan. Bake at 350 for 15 min.
Mix filling while baking crust.
4 eggs&#44; beat well and add
2 cups sugar
4 Tblsp flour
1 tsp bkg pwdr
Slowly stir in 6 T lemon juice&#44; or more to taste.
Pour over crust and continue to bake at 350 for 15-20 min.
Frost while hot with lemon frosting.
2 cups pwdr sugar
4-6 T lemon juice
4 T butter
Sprinkle shredded coconut over the frosting and/or chopped nuts.
The frosting always seems a little short to me so very often I don&#39;t
measure to accurately but add extra of everything.
