<h1>Layer Cookies</h1><p>My mother obtained this recipe from a bake off book. It won a prize and with good reason. These bars went to nearly every potluck and church picnic to say nothing of the countless family picnics also. They freeze well&#44; if you can keep them around long enough. The only &#39;unusual&#39; ingredient is evaporated milk. Not sweetened condensed&#44; evaporated milk.  I prefer putting them in a 9x13 pan instead of a jelly roll pan.  You can do either.

Cream:
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup butter
Add:
1 egg
2 cups flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp bkg pwdr
1 tsp vanilla
Press into pan and bake at 375 for 20-25 min

While baking make second layer:
1/4 cup butter
1/3 cup evaporated milk
1 cup sugar
combine in sauce pan&#44; cook until softball stage&#44; 238-240 degrees F
Spread over baked crust.

Third layer:
Melt 1 cup chocolate chips and spread over all. I like to sprinkle the whole
chips over the top and return to hot oven until the chips begin to melt
and then spread. It is a little easier but don&#39;t let the chips &#39;bake&#39; or burn.</p>
