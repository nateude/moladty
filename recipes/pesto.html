<h1>Pesto</h1><p>The history behind my love affair with Italian cooking: Members in Madison&#44; Keith and Giovanna Perkins&#44; Giovanna&#39;s father was a born and raised in Italy Italian and her German mother learned the art of Italian cooking from her mother-in-law. Givovanna and I spent a long afternoon making pasta and sauces as she had learned them from her mother. Remember how "much" Ryan Omen &#39;loved&#39; it when he had pesto at our house in Fridley? You can thank Nate for getting me to post this. He called for the recipe the other day.

In a blender place:

2 cups packed basil leaves&#44; washed and dried

2 cloves of garlic (or more)

1/2 cup olive oil

Blend until pasty and deep green. Add 1 cup of parmesan cheese&#44; grated and toss over

4 cups hot cooked fettuccine.

Unused portions can be stored in a container. Top the pesto with a layer of olive oil and keep in refrigerator up to a week

or freeze. I do not add the cheese until I toss the pesto on the pasta.</p>
