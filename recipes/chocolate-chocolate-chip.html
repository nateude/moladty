<h1>Chocolate Chocolate Chip</h1><p>Often requested favorites by chocolate lovers&#44; the cookies are close to brownie bites. Best when warm&#44; they don&#39;t keep well long term. But then who cares&#44; make &#39;em &amp; eat &#39;em!

Combine:
3 cups flour
1 cup plus 2 Tbs unsweetened cocoa
1Â 1/2 tsp baking soda
Cream:
1 3/4 cups plus 2 Tbls <span style="text-decoration: underline">butter</span> (3 sticks plus 6 Tbls)
3 cups sugar

3 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
Incorporate dry mixture then stir in 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
and 1 cup nuts (op)

before removing from cookie sheet. Of course if you try
too soon the broken pieces make great quality control!
The cookies beg to be eaten with a glass of milk.
