<h1>New England White Bread</h1><p>Every Saturday my mother baked. She baked yeast breads&#44; rolls&#44; kuchen and coffee cakes. The white bread recipe that follows was the one she used for regular white bread. It was Saturday night supper. What more did you need than fresh bread? It came to the Sunday table instead of rolls and we took it for our sandwiches during the week. I am posting the 6 loaf version. It can be cut in half or even in quarters. The only alteration I have made over the years is using lukewarm water instead of the milk&#44; no heating necessary&#44; and adding milk powder with the flour.

1/2 c melted butter or canola oil

2 c lukewarm water ( warmed milk)

1/2 c sugar

2 T salt

4 pkgs dry yeast (4 scant T)

Mix and add:

5 c luke warm water

18-20 c flour&#44; add the flour slowly&#44; kneading well until smooth and elastic.
Grease and place in greased bowl to double in size. Push down and knead well&#44;
divide into 6 loaves&#44; knead and shape. Place in greased loaf pans and let rise
once more. Bake at 350 for 30 min or until loaves are golden and hollow when tapped.
Brush tops with melted butter when turned out of the pans and let cool.</p>
