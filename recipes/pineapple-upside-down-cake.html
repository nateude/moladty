<h1>Pineapple Upside Down Cake</h1><p>A favorite in the Gurgel home and often Jesse&#39;s choice of a birthday cake. Get creative with the pineapple and cherries on the bottom. Rings with cherries&#44; whole or half in the center&#44; or crushed pineapple with pieces of cherry dotted throughout is pretty too. Pineapple chunks work and taste good&#44; just a little harder to  make decorative.

Melt 2 T of butter and spread in 9 inch pie plate. Press&#44; spread&#44; mix in  1 c of packed brown sugar. Place pineapple as desired over brown sugar mixture&#44; add cherries. Remember the bottom will be the top so if using half cherries&#44; place the cut half upwards. Set pan aside and mix cake.

Cream:
1/4 c butter
1 c sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla
2 egg yolks

Mix:
1 1/2 c flour
2 tsp bkg pwd
add alternately to cream mixture with
1/2 cup milk
Fold in 2 beaten egg whites.
Pour over pineapple .
Bake at 350 for 30 min. I have found that this cake needs to bake for
at least 45 m in or longer to bake through completely. Test middle
with tooth pick. Loosen edges and invert onto serving plate. Serve
warm or cold. Whipped cream is good with this.</p>
