<h1>Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins</h1><p>Here is another oldie but goldie from the nineties edition of the Messiah Hales Corners cookbook. Sue Danielson entered it. Beside the obvious advantage of combining pumpkin with chocolate&#44; it also makes a big batch of muffins&#44; 3 dozen medium. At Christmas time I have baked this in loaf pans for quick bread. Â I believe it makes two medium loaves or one medium and four of the small ones. Either way you bake them&#44; they turn out good.

Combine in bowl:
3 c. flour
2 t bkg soda
2 t bkg pwdr
1 t cinnamon
1 t salt
In a separate bowl combine:
4 eggs&#44; beaten
2 c. sugar
1 16 oz can or 2 cups mashed pumpkin (squash works well also)
1 1/2 c. vegetable oil
Stir into dry ingredients and stir in 12 oz of chocolate chips.
Spoon into medium muffin pans and bake at 400 for 20 minutes.
Makes about 3 dozen.</p>
