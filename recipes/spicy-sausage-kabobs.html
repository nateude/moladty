<h1>Spicy Sausage Kabobs</h1><p>This new favorite came from some time spent browsing on Cooks.com. If you can&#39;t find what you want here on Moldaty&#44; even heirloom recipes can be found there. Â I have changed up the items I add to the kabobs. I have found that if you want to add chicken cook it ahead of time&#44; it takes longer for the chicken and the rest of the stuff gets over done. Shrimp&#44;however works well. I get the large&#44; or jumbo frozen shrimp&#44; rinse it well and wait a few minutes until the skewer goes through easily.

Assemble the skewers&#44; use smoked or Polish sausage cut in chunks&#44; green peppers&#44; corn on cob cut in small chunks&#44; semi-cooked new potatoes&#44; shrimp&#44; pineapple&#44; onions&#44; partially cooked chicken. Use any combination&#44; add some of your own favorites. Put on hot grill and grill 4-5 minutes on each side basting with sauce frequently while kabobs cook.

Sauce:

1/3 cup honey

1/4 cup spicy brown mustard

1/4 cup vegetable oil

1 tsp soy sauce

2 cloves of chopped&#44; minced garlic

1 tsp ground ginger</p>
