<h1>Italian Sausage</h1><p>Looked this up out of necessity. I had pork sausage but not Italian. This is an excellent mix of spices for Italian sausage. I used the exact amounts with one exception. I did not have anise seeds so I put in a few drops of anise extract. Mix the meat vigorously and completely&#44; then let stand in a covered bowl in the frig overnight. I also used 1 pound of pork and 1 pound of beef instead of all pork. Now at Laura&#39;s I am going to mix up a batch with their ground venison. We will see how it turns out.

Update on the venison version. After the first taste test the vote was to double the amount of spices called for when using venison. We&#39;ll post the result.

2 pounds pork
1 tsp black pepper
2 tsp dried parsley
1 tsp garlic pwdr
1 1/2 tsp Italian seasonings
1/8 tsp red pepper flakes
3/4 tsp crushed anise seed
1/2 tsp paprika
1 tsp dried onion flakes (optional)
2 tsp salt</p>
