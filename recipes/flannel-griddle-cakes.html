<h1>Flannel Griddle Cakes</h1><p>Back in the day&#44; when I taught school&#44; isolated in the little city of Lemmon&#44; SD I joined a book club. One of my great purchases was a cook book entitled <em>Our Daily Bread.</em>  Some of you know which one I am referring to. The one with the pages falling out and your Dad&#39;s notes all around the johnny cake recipe. The flannel griddle cakes was a favorite&#44; softer than the power wheat and corn and rye combination I made from the <em>Settlement Cookbook.  </em>Any combination of wheat&#44; white and rye flour works well.

1 cup wheat or white flour
1 cup rye flour
2 tsp bkg pwdr
1 tsp salt
2 T brown sugar
2 eggs beaten
2 cups buttermilk (more or less depending on thick you like them)
2 T sour cream
Mix all and fry&#44; blueberries are a good addition.</p>
