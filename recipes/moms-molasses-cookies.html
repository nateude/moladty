<h1>Mom&apos;s Molasses Cookies</h1><p>There are many ginger snap recipes out there and I have tried most of them. I checked out at cookbook that had recipes from Bed and Breakfast places in the midwest. This is from the Nash House B&amp;B in Wisconsin Rapids. To keep the cookies chewy use shortening (Criso type)&#44; do not substitute butter or maragerine.

Cream:

3/4 cup shortening

1 egg

1/4 cup molasses

1 cup sugar

Mix and add:

2 cups flour

2 tsp bkg soda

1 tsp salt

1 tsp cinnamon

1 tsp cloves

1 tsp ginger

Mix well&#44; dough will be stiff. Roll into balls and roll in cinnamon sugar.Â  Place on lightly greased pan&#44; flatten with glass&#44; bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes.</p>
