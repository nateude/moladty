<h1>Refrigerator Mashed Potatoes</h1><p>5 lbs potatoes&#44; peeled and quartered&#44; boil till fork tender drain
Mash until smooth with potato masher&#44; add:
6 oz cream cheese
1 cup dairy sour cream
2 tlbsp butter
salt-pepper to taste
Mash all until fluffy. Refrigerate up to 2 weeks.
Bake desired amount at 350 for 30 min.
Full amount makes 8 cups.
I usually put them in the slow cooker on to start&#44; Â until
heated thoroughly then turn to low until serving time.
Awesome to make ahead of time and have the mess
cleaned away.</p>
