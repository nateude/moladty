<h1>Cranberry Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1><p>When I found myself with an exceeding amount of cranberries in the freezer I began to search for more ways to use them. I came across this recipe on Cooks.com. I left out the nuts it called for and added the chocolate chips.  For Christmas cookies I make them quite small. The cranberries give them a festive color. The cookies are very moist&#44; almost like a muffin which if you make them larger works well for breakfast with a cup of coffee or tea.

Cream:

1/2c. butter

1 c sugar

3/4 c. brown sugar&#44; packed

Add:

1/4 c milk

2T orange juice

1 egg

Mix well&#44; then mix dry ingredients in a separate bowl and add slowly to above mixture:

3c flour

1/2 t salt

1 t bkg pwdr

1/4 t soda

When mixed add:

2 1/2 c chopped cranberries (that is two and a half cups not twenty-one half cups)

1c chopped nuts or chocolate chips or both.

Drop by teaspoonful onto cookie sheet.

Bake at 375 for 10-12 min.</p>
