<h1>Applesauce Oatmeal Muffins</h1><p>These muffins entered my collection because of Dad&#44; John. They are fairly low in sugar&#44; contain oatmeal&#44; and use applesauce in place of most of the oil. It came from a magazine somewhere and the person who submitted it suggests adding raisins or cranberries and I would suggest craisins would be a good choice as well.

Combine:
1 1/2 c. quick cooking oats
1 1/4 c. flour
1/2 c. packed brown sugar
1 t bkg pwdr
3/4 t bkg pwdr
1/2 t salt
In separate bowl mix:
1 c. applesauce
1/2 c. milk
3 T canola oil
1 egg white
Stir into dry ingredients and spoon into medium muffin tins.
Combine and sprinkle over the top of each muffin:
1/4 c. quick-cooking oats
1 T brown sugar
1/8 t cinnamon
1 T butter
