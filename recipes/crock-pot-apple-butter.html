<h1>Crock-pot Apple Butter</h1><p>Peel and chop enough apples to make 6 quarts or to fill a 5 qt. crock-pot.

Place 1qt of the chopped apples in pot and add 3/4 to 1 cup sugar.

Keep layering 1qt of apple with 3/4 to 1 cup of sugar

DO NOT ADD WATER

Add 11/2 to 2 tsp cinnamon

1 1/2 to 2 tsp cloves 

 

Stir well and cook on low heat 8-9 hours with the lid off the last half of the cooking time.

Cook until thick and spreadable.

If texture is too chunky when cool put through a blender.

Ladel into clean sterilzed jar&#44; seal and waterbath for 10 min.

This is the &#39;neatest&#39; way to make apple butter.  You can do the same thing in a kettle on the stove but you must stir almost constantly to keep from scorching and it will bubble and splurt everywhere while you are waiting for it to get thick.</p>
