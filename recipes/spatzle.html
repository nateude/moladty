<h1>Spatzle</h1><p>Spatzle via Susi Povolny. Not much to say about this except it is a quick way to make a side dish at the last minute. Totally German&#44; use with anything saucy or with chicken soup. I like it with a pork roast and sauerkraut and gravy.

Beat: 2 eggs

combine with :

1 1/2 cups flour

1/2 cup water

1/2 tsp salt

1/4 tsp bkg pwdr.

Beat well&#44; press through Â spatzle maker or drop

off the tip of a teaspoon into boiling&#44; salted water.

Boil for 3 min. after they surface.

Drain and serve hot. Can be rewarmed in

butter.</p>
