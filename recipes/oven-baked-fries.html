<h1>Oven Baked Fries</h1><p>So the next time David wants to cook supper for himself and friends here is how to make oven fries.

<em>Select a quantity of large baking potatoes&#44; russets are the best&#44; one per person</em> unless it is after nine o&#39;clock and you are REALLY hungry&#44; then maybe one itsn&#39;t enough. <em>Scrub the potatoes clean with veggie brush</em> or the one your mother has sitting by the sink that you think will do the trick<em>. Pat the potatoes dry with a paper towe</em><em>l. Slice length wise in half and quarters and continue slicing depending on the size of the potatoes. The thicker the pieces the longer it will take them to bake.</em>

<em>Toss a fair amount of flour in a plastic&#44; ziploc bag.  Add salt&#44; pepper&#44; and any spices you might like&#44; garlic salt&#44; garlic powder&#44; cajun seasoning&#44; smoky mesquite&#44; etc. Shake well.</em> How much flour? Good question&#44; perhaps begin with half a cup&#44; add more if needed.  How many spices? Again good question. Maybe a teaspoon to begin and use your own judgement.

<em>Toss the potato fries in the bag in small portions to coat each fry well. Line the fries on a bar pan that has been brushed with oil. Proceed until all the potatoes are coated and on the pan. Do not make two layers.  The fries maybe crowded slightly together but if you have too many for one pan get out a second pan</em>. It this occurs you are faced with several options. You can go through the cupboards pick a larger pan and grease it and see if THAT will hold them all and continue this process until you find one that works and all the greased pans are strewn on every kitchen counter available OR you can make two pans and bake them one after the other in the oven. If you opt to bake them  in two pans&#44; remember the last pan baking in the oven while you are consuming the first one.  What can happen if you forget? The oven remains on all night and that smell that pervades the house is the last pan of fries slowly crisping and burning to nothing. You turn off the oven and fries remain in the oven all night and stay until mom uses the oven in a day or two and exclaims&#44;"Now that is where my pan went!".  You turn off the oven and remove the fries and the fries remain on top of the stove all night because you made too many and were too full and hadn&#39;t a clue as to what to do with the leftovers. You thought maybe mom might like to eat them for breakfast. Which was a nice thought but she hasn&#39;t yet and probably never will.

<em>Drizzle fries with oil and bake at 400 or 425&#44; depending on how fast you want the fries to get done. Allow 20-30 minutes depending on the size of the fries. Turn fries with spatula half way through baking time. They should be fork tender on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. The amount of oil on the bottom of the pan will determine how crispy they get.</em></p>
