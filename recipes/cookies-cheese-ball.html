<h1>Cookies Cheese Ball</h1><p>Mandy served this one Christmas. I am not sure why we need to add calories to cookies&#44; but give this a try. You will like it. She served it with a tin of store bought butter cookies and I think&#44; also&#44; Teddy Grahams.

Mix together:
8 oz softened cream cheese
1/2 c softened butter
1/4 t vanilla
3/4 c pwdr sugar
2 T brown sugar
3/4 c mini-chocolate chips. (I can see mini-M&amp;M&#39;s in it also)
Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Roll into ball and into
chopped pecans if desired. Serve with graham crackers and
shortbread cookies.</p>
