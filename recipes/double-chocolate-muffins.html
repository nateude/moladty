<h1>Double Chocolate Muffins</h1><p>No story  here except I wanted something similar to the double chocolate ones available at Sam&#39;s Club. Searched Cooks.com and these are good. They recommend Shedd&#39;s Spread&#44; but I use canola oil. They also say to use mini-chocolate chips but I use regular when I don&#39;t have the mini size. So far&#44; no one here has complained.

In a large bowl combine:
2 c. flour
3/4 c. cocoa powder
1 c. sugar
1 T bkg pwdr
In a separate bowl combine:
1 large beaten egg
1 c. milk
1/2 c. canola oil or melted Shedd Spread
Stir the wet ingredients into the dry and add
1 1/2 c. chocolate chips&#44; regular or mini.
Spoon into 12 regular muffin cups and  bake
at 400 for 20 minutes.</p>
