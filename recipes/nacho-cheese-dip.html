<h1>Nacho Cheese Dip</h1><p>A favorite of everyones&#44; this came from the Messiah Cookbook from Mrs. Quade.  Perfect in a crock pot for games and picnics.  Spray pot well with Pam or the cheese crusted on the edges takes forever to get clean.

Brown 1 lb of ground beef

Add chopped onions and green peppers and cook until soft.

Dump in crock pot and add:

1 can cream of mushroom soup

1 8 ounce block of Velveeta cheese

1/4 cup margerine

1 cup salsa

Salt&#44; pepper&#44; taco seasonings and Smokey Mesquitefflavoring to taste.

Let all meld together on low or high heat depending on time available.

Short cut method:

To the browned beef add:

1 can mushroom soup

1 jar salsa

1 jar Mexican cheese dip with spices already added.

Works just as well.

This is easy to adjust to taste or amount.  If too thick add some more salsa or a little evaporated milk.  Add more cheese and less beef.  I have even added shredded cheddar cheese just before serving for a zippier flavor.</p>
