<h1>Italian Roast Beef Sandwiches</h1><p>Always a hit with  family and guests. I have served this with many different kinds of home made and purchased rolls. The crustier and thicker the rolls the more of the juice they sop up and the better the sandwich. In the last year I have discovered an easier way of making these. Same great taste&#44; less work. Amanda did a similar recipe in the crockpot and I doubt I will go back to the time consuming way again. So here is the NEW and improved Italian Roast Beef Sandwich.

Place a large beef roast in the crockpot.

Combine the sauce ingredients and pour over roast. Cook in crockpot on low 8-9 hours or until fork tender. Pull&#44; shred&#44; cut&#44; meat from bone (if there is one) and remove fat. Add meat back into sauce. Serve immediatly on crusty rolls or refrigerate until ready to reheat and serve.

Sauce for a 1-3 pound roast:

2 cups water

2 tsp beef bouillon

4 cloves minced garlic

1 tsp dried oregano&#44; crushed

1 tsp crushed red pepper

1/4 tsp black pepper

3 medium green peppers cut into strips

Pour over roast in crockpot. You can substitue beef broth for water and bouillon&#44; onions are a good addition and I often just throw in Italian seasonings instead of just oregano.  You are suppose to serve this with french fries but potato salad is just as good.</p>
