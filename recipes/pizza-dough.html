<h1>Pizza Dough</h1><p>While Matt and Nate are trekking by train and bus across India I have had another child ask about pizza dough.  So it is high time I include this basic recipe here on Moladty.  This makes one thicker crust pizza or two medium slightly thinner crusts.  If you double it  you easily get three large or four plus medium pizza&#39;s.

Mix in this order:

1 cup lukewarm water

1 scant Tablsp yeast

2 Tablsp olive oil/butter/margarine/crisco/ vegetable oil

1 Tblsp honey/sugar

1 tsp salt

Add slowly:

3 cups flour

Knead well let rise.

Any variation of Italian seasonings may be added with the or instead of the salt.  Whole wheat flour may be used for part of the flour.

This is the same recipe I use for making bread sticks.

A short cut to raising dough is this.

Place dough in microwave safe large greased(spray with Pam) bowl.  Spray or grease top of dough.  Get a dish towel wet with HOT water and ring out well.  Place over bowl.  Put in microwave and set for 10 minutes on power level 1 or 10%.  Anything higher than that will begin to bake it and it will smell really good but the dough will be ruined.  Sometimes the dough will be ready to use after 10 minutes.  Sometimes you will have to let it sit awhile.  It depends on the temperature of the water&#44; flour etc.  Even when it doesn&#39;t look like it has really risen I have used it and it turns out just fine.</p>
