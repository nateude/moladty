<h1>Brown Sugar Syrup</h1><p>When the real maple syrup is too expensive&#44; or gone this is a quick fix. We have used it all through the years for pancakes&#44; waffles&#44; cornbread and bread pudding. It is sweet and sticky. What more do you need?

In a kettle combine and boil until clear.
1 c brown sugar
1 c white sugar
1 c water

Watch carefully because is boils over quickly and easily and makes a sticky mess on the stove when it does so. To make it thicker you can add 1 c Karo syrup&#44; white or dark. I seldom do that.</p>
