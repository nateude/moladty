<h1>Snicker Bar Fudge</h1><p>Every year I make these&#44; every year the layers separate. I have tried several methods of avoiding this but have yet to be successful. However&#44; these are a standard at Christmas. I will give the recipe at it is written. If you manage to keep all the layers together from making to serving&#44; let me know.

Bottom layer:
1/2 c butter
1/3 c baking cocoa
1/4 c packed brown sugar
1/4 c milk
Combine and bring to boil. Add
3 1/2 c confectioners sugar
1 t vanilla
Pour into buttered or greased 8x8 pan
Second layer: Heat until melted:
30 caramels unwrapped
1 T water
Add
2 cups salted peanuts and spread over bottom layer.
Melt:
1/2 c semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 c milk chocolate chips
Chill until firm. Cut and hope the layers stay intact.</p>
