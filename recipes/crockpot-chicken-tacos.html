<h1>Crockpot Chicken Tacos</h1><p>Found this recipe of Jess&#39; when we were unpacking after their move to Maple Grove. It is&#44; she assures me&#44; as awesome and easy as it looks. Besides using it for tacos&#44; I think it would work for an excellent salad as well as serving it over cooked rice.

Dump in slow cooker-
1 6oz jar of salsa
1 envelope of taco seasoning ( I would add smokey mesquite as wells)
6 pieces of boneless&#44; skinless chicken breasts
Give it a little stir to blend seasonings.
Cook on high 4-6 hours or low 6-8
When done the chicken should shred easily when stirred with a fork.
Use leftovers for enchiladas&#44; nachos&#44; quesadillas or tortilla soup.
