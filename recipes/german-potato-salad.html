<h1>German Potato Salad</h1><p>German potato salad&#44; brats and hamburgers on the grill&#44; definitely summer in Wisconsin. The salad recipe might have come from the German community in Milwaukee where my mother grew up&#44; but it didn&#39;t stay there. This potato salad got carted along on picnics into the Arizona desert&#44; South Mountain&#44; Superstition Mountains&#44; Horse Thief Basin to name just a few. Mother took it along to Wyoming&#44; up to the reservoirs where Dad cast for trout&#44; to the Snowy Range where we slid down banks of snow in July and down to Denver and up through Bib Thompson Canyon and Rocky Mountain National Park. It stayed with us when we came back to Wisconsin. If we had been a tail- gating family it would have mingled with the brats and burgers grilling outside of County Stadium.  We ate it hot and we ate it cold. I like to make it ahead of time and heat it slowly on low in the crock pot.

Boil&#44; peel&#44; and slice 1 qt of potatoes. Small red are the best to use.

Dressing:

4 slices bacon chopped and browned&#44; add

1 onion chopped and browned in same pan as bacon

Mix and add:

3Tbl flour

1Tbl sugar

2 tsp dry mustard

Stir into bacon and onion and drippings until paste is made.

Slowly stir in:

3/4 cup vinegar

1 cup water

Stir until smooth and thick. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Mom always substituted part evaporated milk for the water. Good both ways.  I use the water.

Pour over potatoes and toss gently. Can be served immediately or left to meld the flavors</p>
