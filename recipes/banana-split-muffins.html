<h1>Banana Split Muffins</h1><p>Anyone who has the nineties version of the Messiah Hales Corners cookbook will find this recipe on page 84. Donna Griffen submitted it and it has been a favorite over the years. Dresses up the bananas into something a little tastier.  The Miracle Whip is used in place of oil or butter. I have never substituted anything for it.  A few of the boys don&#39;t like Miracle Whip but they all like these. If bananas have to go bad&#44; this is a good way to go. And of course it adds chocolate&#44; what&#39;s not to like?

Mix:
1 1/2 c. flour
1 c. sugar
1 t salt
1 t bkg pwdr
In a separate bowl beat:
1 egg
1/2 c. Miracle Whip
3 ripe&#44; mashed bananas
Add to dry ingredients and stir
until just moistened. Spoon into 12
medium muffin cups. Sprinkle the
tops of the muffins with chopped peanuts
and chocolate chips. Bake at 375 for 20-25
minutes. Top while warm with a Maraschino
cherry&#44; pressed slightly into muffin. (I often
cut the cherry in half and place cut
side down.)</p>
