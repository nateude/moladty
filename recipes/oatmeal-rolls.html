<h1>Oatmeal Rolls</h1><p>No story here&#44; simply a recipe I found&#44; tried&#44; liked and have used&#44; and will have used often.

2 cups water- bring to boil add:
1 cup dry oatmeal
3 Tblsp butter- bring to boil and simmer 1 minute-cool to 120-130 degrees:
Mix in:
2 scant Tblsp yeast (2 packages)
2/3 cup brown sugar
1 Tblsp sugar
1 tsp salt
5-5 3/4 cup flour
Mix and knead well. Let rise. Punch dough&#44; knead and shape into
24 rolls. (I find 24 makes them larger than needed for dinner rolls)
Let rise until double bake at 350 for 20-30 min. (For sure 30 if the
pan is crowded&#44; maybe slightly longer. The inside rolls have on
occasion been doughy.)</p>
