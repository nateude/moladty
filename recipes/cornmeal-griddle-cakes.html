<h1>Cornmeal Griddle Cakes</h1><p>The history of this recipe is fairly short. I came across it somewhere and made them and liked them. Since Hales Corners I had lost track of the recipe. Gwen Koch mentioned that she loved the cornmeal griddle cake recipe she had gotten from me. I got it back. Still don&#39;t know where or which cookbook it came from.  Now I am posting it so I don&#39;t lose it again.
