<h1>Pork and Kraut Roast</h1><p>Brown pork roast&#44; season&#44; place in roaster.  Dump one jar of sauerkraut with all the juice on top.  Sprinkle half cup of brown sugar over kraut.  Bake at 375 for 2-2 1/2 hours.  Remove kraut and stir in bowl.  Remove roast and slice.  Make gravy from liquid and serve all with mashed potatoes.  If you don&#39;t like the kraut don&#39;t eat it but the roast and gravy will be safe.

I found this recipe on Cooks.com.  It is the best.  I would assume that you could do the whole thing in a crockpot as well as the oven.  I thought I was going to have leftovers.  The two small meals I did manage to put in the frig were gone the next day!</p>
