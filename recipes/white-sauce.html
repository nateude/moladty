<h1>White Sauce</h1><p>This is for and because of Christopher. Every time he wants to make lasagna he wants to know how to make the white sauce I use in place of the ricotta cheese.  So here it is&#44; just for him. You may also stir in grated cheese after the sauce is hot to use as a vegetable sauce or over pasta. If it is too thick thin with small amounts of cool milk.  Remember to add the cheese slowly so it doesn&#39;t lump or curdle.

Melt:

3 Tblsp butter

Stir in:

3 Tblsp flour

Slowly stir in:

1 cup milk

Heat and stir until thick. Add any desired seasonings.

If lumpy blend or whisk smooth.</p>
