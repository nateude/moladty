<h1>Texas Caviar</h1><p>We had this for the first time at Aaron and Meghan&#39;s. It is a nice change from salsa. The fresh parsley and cilantro give it a zip.

2 green onions chopped

1/2 medium onion chopped

1 small jalapeno pepper&#44; seeded and chopped

1 can shoepeg corn drained

1 can black-eyed peas drained

2 medium tomatoes chopped

1 green pepper chopped

1T fresh cilantro chopped

1 T fresh parsley chopped

2 cloves garlic chopped

Mix all&#44; store in frig. Just before serving mix in Italian dressing to taste. Only mix what you are going to eat.

Keeps better if not mixed.

I added LOTS more parsley and cilantro and more tomatoes.

Serve with tortilla chips or Italian bread.</p>
