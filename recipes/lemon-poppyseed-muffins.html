<h1>Lemon Poppyseed Muffins</h1><p>The recipe is on newsprint. The heading identifies it as coming from a book called "Innkeepers&#39; Best Quick Breads." It is a &#39;best&#39; as far as I am concerned.  However&#44; there is nothing&#44; low fat&#44; low sugar about it. I stole the lemon glaze from Susi Povolny&#39;s Lemon bread and added it to these. Is it possible to make the &#39;best&#39; better? In this case&#44; yes.

Cream:
1/2 c butter (use the real stuff&#44; please)
1 c sugar
2 eggs&#44; beat in
Stir in:
zest from 2 large lemons or a good dose of lemon flavoring or both
2 T poppyseeds
In a separate bowl combine:
1 1/2 c flour
1/2 tsp bkg pwdr
1/2 t salt
Add dry ingredients to the cream mixture alternately with
1/2 c milk
When mixed spoon into muffin cups. Recipe says it makes 30&#44; but that is mini-muffins&#44; if I remember correctly it makes less than a dozen regular sized muffins. Nine&#44; I think. Bake at 350 about 20 min or until lightly browned and baked through. As soon as possible when removed from the oven poke tops with fork all over. Make lemon glaze and drizzle over muffins&#44; repeat until glaze is used up.

Dissolve 1/2 c sugar in juice of one lemon. Pour over muffins. I seldom have fresh lemons and use the equivalent of Real Lemon juice. The muffins will be slightly sticky but extra tasty.</p>
