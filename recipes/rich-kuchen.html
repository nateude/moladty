<h1>Rich Kuchen</h1><p>Used the good old Settlement Cookbook to make Nutella Rolls at Laura&#39;s house. Simply pick a cinnamon/kuchen recipe&#44; roll and spread with Nutella. Proceed as for cinnamon rolls. I liked the light&#44; rich dough this made.
Mix:
1 pkg dry yeast
1/4 c. water
Set aside and combine:
1 c. softened butter
1/2 c sugar
3 eggs
1 tsp salt
Stir in:
1 c warm milk
Add yeast and water mix
Stir in 4-5 1/2 c flour&#44; knead&#44;Â let rise:
Punch down roll and shape as desired.
This made a dozen rather large rolls that fit nicely
in a 9x13 pan.
Bake at 375 25-30 min.</p>
