<h1>Bird&apos;s Nest Cookies</h1><p>Combine in large bowl and let sit:

3 cups crispy rice cereal

1 cup shredded coconut

Mix and bring to just boiling:

1/3 cup light corn syrup

1/2 cup brown sugar

3/4 cup peanut butter

1 tsp vanilla

Remove from heat and pour over cereal and coconut.  Shape into bird&#39;s nests.  I push the mixture into the mini-cup cake pans lined with papers.  You have to really pack well and let sit to coo.  Fill depression with jelly beans &#39;eggs&#39;.</p>
