<h1>Rhubarb Custard Pie</h1><p>Grandma Gurgel&#39;s and best rhubarb pie I have ever had. Takes a double crust and a scoop of ice cream on top while the pie is till warm&#44; mmmmmm&#44; the best.

3 c chopped rhubarb
1 1/2 c sugar
1/4 t salt
1/4 t nutmeg
2 eggs beaten
3 T cream or evaporated milk
3 T flour
Mix all and pour into pie crust&#44; top with second crust and seal edges.
Cut slits in top crust and bake for 15 min at 425&#44; reduce heat to
350 and bake for 30 min longer. I find this is not long enough for rhubarb
to become tender. I test the pie with a fork inserted through the top crust
slits until the fruit is fork tender. Reduce heat to keep top crust from becoming
too brown.

Frozen rhubarb works as well as fresh.</p>
