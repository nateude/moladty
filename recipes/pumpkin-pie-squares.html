<h1>Pumpkin Pie Squares</h1><p>Tired of the pumpkin pie that no one wants to finish? These pie squares are a great alternative. Easy to take to potlucks&#44; Â easier than pie to make&#44; the recipe comes from a Farm Journal cookbook. I have substituted squash freely for the pureed pumpkin. Personally&#44; I like the deeper flavor of squash better&#44; but either works.

Combine:
1 c. flour
1/2 c. quick cooking oats
Cut in:
1/2 c. butter
Press into 13x9x2 inch pan. (Note&#44; make sure the sides are high like a cake pan&#44; filling will rise and run over anything lower.)
Bake at 350 for 15 min
For filling combine:
2 c pureed pumpkin or squash
1 (13 1/2 0z.) can<strong> evaporated</strong> milk
2 eggs
3/4 c. sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp ginger
1/4 tsp ground cloves
Pour over crust after the first 15 min bake time. Return to oven and bake 20 min.
For topping combine:
1/2 c chopped pecans
1/2 c firmly packed brown sugar
2 Tblsp butter
Cut or mix with fingers until crumbly.
At the end of the 20 min baking period sprinkle topping over filling. Return to oven
and bake 20 min or until filling is set. Cool on rack and cut.
