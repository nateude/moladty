<h1>Stollen</h1><p>1 1/2 cup butter

4 egg yolks

1/2 sugar

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon vanilla

2 1/2 cups luke warm milk

2 Tablespoons yeast

8 cups flour

Dissolve yeast in warm milk&#44; add  butter&#44; egg yolks sugar&#44; salt and vanilla&#44; beat until smooth&#44; stir/knead in the flour.  Sprinkle a good quantity of raisins and chopped citron fruit and nuts if desired with rum.  Add with portions of the flour as you knead.  I keep adding fruit until it falls out of the dough.  Use as much as possible.  Let rise&#44; shape into loaves let rise again and bake at 350  for 45 minutes.  These loaves are easy to underbake so be careful.  Frost with powdered sugar frosting when nearly cool.  Makes two big loaves&#44; I usually brake it up into about 4 samller ones.

This is  not the exact receipe for stollen that my mother and grandmother used.  They used the one out of the Settlement Cook Book.  I use this because I like the amount it makes and it is a little richer dough and easier to handle when making.  The taste is the same.  Plenty rum sprinkled as you add the fruit and nuts and a tinge or rum in the frosting is good.  That is how my mother did it.  Mother made this for Christmas every year and often also for Easter.  I prefer the butterhorns at Easter.

This is what mother made for the teacher gifts while we were growing up.  Every grade school teacher got a tin foil wrapped loaf&#44; tied with a red ribbon.  I remember Shriley Wendland rubbing her hands in glee when she got to that gift in the pile she was opening.</p>
