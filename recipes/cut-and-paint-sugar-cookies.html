<h1>Cut and Paint Sugar Cookies</h1><p>Cream:

1 cup butter

1 cup sugar

Beat in:

1 egg

1 tsp vanilla

1 Tblsp milk

Add and mix well:

2 3/4 cup flour

1 tsp bkg pwdr

1/4 tsp salt

Chill dough several hours. Roll and cut.  Paint with clean brushes before baking.

Bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes

Paint

Crack one egg and beat with a little water to thin.  Divide into small containers (muffin pans work well).

Add food coloring to each container.  Mix well.

Paint cookies&#44; washing brushes well before dipping in a new color.

For more intense colors use less water or even just the egg yolk.

A little paint goes a long way and sugar sprinkled over the painted cookies before baking is very pretty.

The cookie recipe is from the Messiah&#44; Hales Corners cookbook.  It is Lisa Lisaks and best sugar cookie recipe I have used.

Cookies come out flat and the paint shows up nicely with little cracking during baking.</p>
