<h1>Honey Whole Wheat Bread</h1><p>Marie Meyer and I have been friends since we were freshman in high school. I spent a number of holidays at the Meyer farm. Marie and I have  a clutch of good memories from those days. I remember the Meyer kitchen. It consisted of an immense expanse of both table and counter space where three or four different processes or projects were usually in progress simultaneously. Mrs. Meyer turned out as good a loaf of bread as my mother.  I have used her honey whole wheat bread as often as mom&#39;s white bread recipe.
