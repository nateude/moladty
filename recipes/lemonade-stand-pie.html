<h1>Lemonade Stand Pie</h1><p>Great&#44; light summer dessert I got off the back of a Cool Whip label.

Beat:
1 can (6 ounces) partially thawed lemonade concentrate. (Any flavor works)
1 pint (2 cups) Â softened vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt
Fold in:
1 8-ounce tub of Cool Whip
Pour into prepared graham cracker pie crust (8 in). Freeze 4 hours. Let stand at room temperature
until pie can be easily cut. Garnish with strawberries&#44; raspberries etc if desired.</p>
