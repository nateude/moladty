<h1>Snow Cream</h1><p>The urban legend that making snow ice cream is bad for you has been&#44; (according to one newspaper article) debunked. Snow ice cream is perfectly safe to eat. Here is the recipe direct from the article.

Place a clean container outside to capture fresh snow. In a smaller bowl (presumably in the kitchen) combine 1 cup of milk or cream&#44; 1/2 cup of granulated sugar&#44; 1 tsp of vanilla&#44; a dash of salt. Stir the mixture until the sugar has dissolved then combine it with the fresh snow.

The article does not say how much fresh snow to use. Try it&#44; let us know what you did and how it works.</p>
