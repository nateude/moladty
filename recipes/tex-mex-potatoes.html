<h1>Tex-Mex Potatoes</h1><p>Aaron called for this one last night so here it is

Hamburger browned( onions anf green peppers if desired chopped and browned with it.)

Taco seasoning to taste

garlic in any form

Taco seasoning and I also throw in a healthy dose of Smokey Misquite

can of refried beans

salsa and enough water to make more like a sauce than paste.

Simmer&#44; add water and taste often with tortilla chips to make sure the flavor is just right.

Spoon over baked potato and top with sour cream&#44; onion&#44; salsa&#44; taco chips crushed and cheese.</p>
