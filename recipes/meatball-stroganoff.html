<h1>Meatball Stroganoff</h1><p>Louise Mayhew added to my collection of recipes the two summers they lived as our &#39;neighbors&#39; while Jack oversaw the work on a new building. Her recipe for Meatball Stroganoff is a family favorite. It is asy&#44; and yet impressive enough to use for a company dinner. If you are making  large quantities of meatballs put them on a cookie sheet and bake in a 400 oven to brown. No turning needed so they don&#39;t fall apart in the process. Place the browned meatballs in a kettle&#44; scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pan and add with the water to the kettle. Or cool and freeze them  to use later.
