<h1>Banana Bread</h1><p>Once upon a time&#44; a very long time ago&#44; Grandma Ude gave me a cookbook. It is a very practical cookbook&#44; the kind that uses ingredients we have grown in the garden&#44; good meat and potato kind of a cookbook.  This cookbook has gotten pretty spattered over the years. It is the one I use for &#39;Crusty Hot Biscuits&#39;&#44; opens right to that page. It is also the cookbook that I use for the banana bread recipe. Now banana bread&#44; is banana bread&#44; is banana bread but this recipe uses a tinge of lemon juice. I think it makes the bread a little zippier and lighter.  From the <em>Farm Journal</em> cookbook here is the banana bread recipe I use.
Sift:

3 1/2 c flour

3 tsp bkg pwdr

1 tsp salt

1 tsp soda

Mash 4-5 ripe bananas to make 2 cups.

Add to bananas 2 tblsp lemon juice (Real Lemon works) and let sit.

Cream:

3/4 c shortening&#44; or butter

1 1/2 c sugar

Then add dry ingredients alternately to cream mixture with

3/4 c milk

Fold in bananas and add 1 cup chocolate chips&#44; or chopped nuts or both. Beat and mix well.

Pour into two greased loaf pans and bake at 350 for 1 hour or until wooden pick inserted into the middle comes out dry. Let stand 10 min. Remove from pans and let cool. These freeze well. Cool well or overnight before wrapping or cutting.
