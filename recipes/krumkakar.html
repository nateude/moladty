<h1>Krumkakar</h1><p>This reciepe was given to me by a woman we both babysat for and worked with at the Ben Franklin store.  She knew her way around Scandinavian foods.  There are other reciepe&#39;s out there but this is the only one I have used.  The trick with these is to get them thin and delicate&#44; but not too thin so they have holes.  Turning the iron at the right time is important so that both sides are done to the same color.  However the side that looks least appetizing can be the side you roll inside.  The other trick is to get the right amount of batter in the iron so you don&#39;t waste batter by having it ooze out when you close the iron.    God Jul---Norwegian I believe for Merry Christmas.

1 cup sugar

1/2 cup melted butter

1tsp vanilla

3 eggs

1/2 cup whipping cream (not whipped!)

1 1/2 cup flour

pinch of nutmeg

Beat eggs light&#44; add cream and flour to handle easily.  Put about 1 tblsp of batter in iron.  Bake&#44; and roll.  Cool on wire rack&#44; fill just before serving with whipped cream if desired.</p>
