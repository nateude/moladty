<h1>Classic Spritz Cookies</h1><p>After years of trying various recipes with varying success I have settled on this version. It came with the Pampered Chef cookie press. After years of varying success and frustration with getting the cookies to press out of the tube  I thought I finally had the answer.  Make certain the butter is warm&#44; room temperature&#44;&#44; when you mix the cookies.  It worked without a hitch. The cookies came out easily&#44; I did not give up in frustration. I made a second batch. The first success must have been a fluke. I was back to the same problems as always. Laura suggested spraying the form plate with Pam. She tried it and had no problems.  Go for it&#44; even if you end up with undefinable mounds instead of daintily shaped cookies&#44; they taste good. I  add almond flavoring to the recipe and a few drops of food coloring&#44; red or green to make them festive.
