<h1>Master Mix</h1><p>Here is a Bisquick wanna be-- I am giving you the original cut in half.  This can be used in any recipe calling for Bisquick. It stores well.

&nbsp;

Mix in large bowl:
4 1/2 c. flour
1/2 T salt
1 t cream of tartar
2 1/2 T bkg pwdr
2 T sugar
1/2 c. dry milk pwdr (this may be skipped and fluid  milk added when mixing later instead of water.)
Stir and cut in:
1 c. shortening
Store in zip lock bag or air tight container.

To make biscuits:
Mix in bowl:
3 c. master mix with 2/3 to 1 cup water (if no milk pwdr was added to mix&#44; use fluid milk in place of water)
Stir until blended&#44; knead briefly&#44; roll or pat&#44;
or drop by tablespoon onto sheet.
Bake for 10 min at 400.

To make pancakes:
Mix in bowl:
3 c. mix
1 1/2 c. water (or fluid milk if no  milk pwdr was added to mix)
