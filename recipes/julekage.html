<h1>Julekage (Christmas Bread)</h1><p>Last Christmas I tried a different recipe for Christmas Bread. Most of you did not notice that I slightly altered tradition. Aaron did&#44; he recognized it right away. The ingredients are basically the same&#44; and of course contains raisins and cardamom. What I like about this recipe is it is easier to follow and the texture of the bread is slightly more compact. I also like the melted butter and cinnamon sugar that coat the loaves after baking. Every year I debate exactly how much cardamom to use. The recipe calls for 1/2 teaspoon crushed seeds. I start with 1-2 tablespoons&#44; sniff&#44; and add some more. I only use cardamom that Matt brings&#44; or from a co-op type store. Fresh as possible is the best. Â The recipe comes from my Scandinavian recipe book.

3 c scalded milk
1/2 cup butter melted in milk
when cooled to lukewarm add:
2 T yeast
1 cup sugar
2 beaten eggs
2 tsp salt
1 T ground cardamom (or more)
2 cups raisins
Mix and add:
10-11 cups flour
Knead well and let rise until double in bulk. Punch down and knead again and let rise a second time. Cut into portions and knead into loaves&#44; four or five depending on your pans. Let rise&#44; brush tops with egg yolk beaten with a little milk. Bake at 375 for 45-50 minutes. Brush baked loaves with melted butter and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.</p>
