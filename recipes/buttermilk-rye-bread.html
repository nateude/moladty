<h1>Buttermilk Rye Bread</h1><p>I know&#44; I know how many of my children dislike rye bread. This&#44; however&#44; is not dark rye and does not have caraway seed. The buttermilk gives it a lovely moist texture and the molasses flavor is awesome The bread is delicious spread with butter and topped with a slice of cheese. It also makes a great burger sandwich or grilled with ham and cheese.  My mother collected this recipe from somewhere&#44; but that is as close to an origin that I know.

Mix in bowl:
1 1/2 c rye flour
1 1/2 c whole wheat flour
2 T dry yeast or 2 pkgs yeast
1 T salt (I use half of this amount)
In a pan or glass measuring cup combine:
1/2 c  water
1 1/2 c  buttermilk
1/3 c molasses
1/4 c oil
Heat to 120-130 and add to dry mixture. Blend well and
gradually stir in&#44; 1/2 c rye flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat and
stir in enough white flour to make a firm dough. Knead well&#44;
grease and place in bowl. Let rise until double in bulk&#44; punch
down and knead again&#44; divide into two loaves and place in
greased pans. Let rise and bake 35-40 min at 375.
