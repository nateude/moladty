<h1>CRANBERRY PORK CHOPS</h1><p>My Dad made these once. Lost the recipe and had to look it up. Might not be exactly what he did&#44; but it sounds good to me.
If I had started earlier I would have done them in the slow cooker- 4 hrs on high. You can easily make your own cranberry sauce.
Simply add 1/4 c. water and 1 c sugar to 2 c whole cranberries(fresh or frozen). Cook until berries pop and sauce is slightly thick. 5 min maybe is all it takes.

8 pork loin chops&#44; 3/4 inch thick
2 tbsp. shortening
Salt&#44; pepper&#44; ground cloves&#44; nutmeg
1 (16 oz.) whole cranberry sauce
1/2 c. barbecue sauce
1/4 c. water
1/4 tsp. cornstarch
2 tbsp. cold water
In skillet&#44; brown chops seasoned with salt&#44; pepper&#44; cloves and nutmeg. Drain excess fat. Combine cranberry&#44; barbecue and 1/4 cup water. Pour over chops. Cover and simmer 1 hour. Remove chops to plate and keep warm. Combine cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water&#44; stir into sauce in skillet. Cook until thickened. Serve over rice.</p>
