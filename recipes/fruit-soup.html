<h1>Fruit Soup</h1><p>Soak in water to cover 2 hours:

1/2 cup pearl tapioca

Drain and combine in large saucepan:

6 cups water

2 cups grape or apple juice (I use grape and often use more juice and less water)

2 stick cinnamon

1 Tblsp grated orange rind

2 Tblsp grated lemon rind

1/2 cup orange juice

2 Tblsp lemon juice

2 cups mixed dried fruit cut into small pieces. (Spray a scissors with Pam and cut)

1 cup raisins

Cook gently 2-3 hours until the tapioca is clear.  Stir off and on to prevent sticking.

Slices of lemon and orange can be added just before serving.

Add sugar to taste if desired.  I use very little&#44; the recipe called for 3/4 of a cup which made it too sweet.</p>
