<h1>Cajun-Curry chicken</h1><p>This recipe works well in either a crockpot or simply in the oven.  It is easy to prepare. I came across it in a magazine.  Couldn&#39;t tell you which one.

Mix and pour over 6 skinless&#44; boneless chicken breasts.

1/3 cup honey

3 Tblspn water

3Tblspn prepared mustard

3 tsp Cajun seasoning

3 tsp curry

1 tsp lemon juice

1 clove garlic

Cook in crock pot on high 4 hours&#44; low 6-8 hours or bake in the oven at 350 45-60 minutes.  Serve over hot rice&#44; sauce does not need to be thickened.  If the chicken breasts are smaller reduce cooking time.</p>
