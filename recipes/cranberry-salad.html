<h1>Cranberry Salad</h1><p>Grandma Gurgel&#39;s recipe&#44; she got this from Mrs. Harkner of Milston along with buckets of cranberries right from the bogs.

3 cups ground cranberries (best to toss frozen in blender to chop)

1 cup crushed pineapple drained&#44;

21 marshmallows cut in pieces or the equivalent amount of minis

3 apples ground&#44; with peel (toss in with cranberries as you grind them)

1 cup sugar

Mix all&#44; just before serving fold in 1/2 cup whipped cream or cool whip.</p>
