<h1>Iced Spiced Coffee</h1><p>4 quarts strong hot coffee

add:

10 whole cloves

2 stick cinnamon

Let steep for several hours

add 1 pint cream

Stir and serve over lots of ice

This is an awsome cold coffee drink.  I added the spices to the pot as I made the coffee.  It didn&#39;t steep as long as the receipe said because Matthew said if I didn&#39;t make it soon he was going to drink hot.  I used one can of evaporated milk instead of the cream and then blended the coffee mix and ice together.    Squirt on a dollop of whipped cream or add a splash of chocolate syrup.  A great cool way to wake up your day!</p>
